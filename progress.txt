## Current Implementation: Story 5.1 - Time Window Preset Creation

### Database Schema
- Added `timeWindowPresets` table with fields:
  - `id`, `companyId`, `name`, `type`
  - `startTime`, `endTime` (for SHIFT and RANGE types)
  - `exactTime`, `toleranceMinutes` (for EXACT type)
  - `strictness` (HARD/SOFT), `active`, timestamps

### API Endpoints
- `GET/POST /api/time-window-presets` - List and create presets
- `GET/PATCH/DELETE /api/time-window-presets/[id]` - Individual preset operations

### Validation
- Zod schemas for create, update, and query operations
- Type-specific validation (SHIFT, RANGE, EXACT)
- Time format validation (HH:MM)
- End time must be after start time validation
- Unique name validation within company

### Frontend
- Page: `/time-window-presets` - Full CRUD interface
- Form component with type-specific fields
- Table display with filtering by type, strictness, and active status
